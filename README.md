# E-Commerce-API
This project is a simple e-commerce API with JWT authentication, allowing users to view products, manage their cart, and place orders. It supports two roles: customers (shop only) and admins (can manage products). Optional features include product search, pagination, and a basic HTML frontend for interaction
